    // Other things
    // 1.  Use separators between functions so we know where they end, like so:

    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    // 2.  Make sure keep lines of code & comments <80 characters per line, 
    // unless it is impossible to do so

    // 3.  Use m_X for class variable names, where X is a variable name in 
    // uppercase camelCase, like m_VariableName
    
    // 4.  Use e_X for enum instances similar to (3) above.
    
    // 5.  Use understandable names for variables.  Don't use temp when you could
    // use something like m_EnemyList instead

    // Feel free to add more that makes sense
